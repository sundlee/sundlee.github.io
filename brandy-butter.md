## Ingredients

* 225g / 8 oz unsalted butter at room temperature
* 750g / 1 1/2 lb icing (powdered) sugar, sifted
* Grated peel of a fresh, washed orange (use organic/homegrown where possible)
* 2 tbsp orange juice
* 2 tbsp brandy

## Method

1. Place the butter in a mixing bowl and beat using an electric hand beater, or a whisk, until light and fluffy.
2. Add the icing sugar and mix thoroughly to form a smooth paste. This is best done by adding the icing sugar in gradually.
3. Add the orange peel, juice and brandy to the mixture. Combine gently.
4. Dollop the orange brandy butter into a serving or storage container in advance of the event. This can be kept for up to six weeks, covered and refrigerated.

## Notes

* This recipe makes approximately 1kg (2 lb) of orange brandy butter.
* If you want to give this as a gift, place the butter in a nice small jar with a lid. Cover the lid with fabric and add a label describing the contents. Be sure to add that the item needs refrigeration.
