I’m a SW engineer.

Did I mention I’m obsessed with tools? [TextMate][tm] is the my favorite and I use it for just about everything I work on. This site is published using [Jekyll][jk] which “…is a blog-aware, static site generator in Ruby.” The [source for the site][src] and the site itself is hosted on GitHub.
