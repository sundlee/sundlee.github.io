This is a demo site, accompanying a tutorial on 24 ways about [getting started with Git Pages and Jekyll](http://24ways.org/2013/get-started-with-github-pages/).

Recipes and images are licensed under a [Creative Commons Attribution/Share-Alike License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/).

## Usage

Files can be edited on the [Github site](https://github.com/maban/christmas-recipes/), or locally. For full instructions on how to edit files locally using Jekyll, [follow the tutorial on 24 ways](http://24ways.org/2013/get-started-with-github-pages/).

Recipes are formatted in [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).

Jekyll generates the raw files into the <i>_sites</i> folder, so do no edit any of the files in here.
